# This import is not used anywhere else, but is very important to register
# the user registered signal receiver. So please don't remove it. Although
# it against style to put any imports in the end of the file, this is
# intentional so that this import may not be removed accidentally when
# cleaning up other unused imports.
# Although this import is not directly used in this module, but it is
# imported here so that it executes the code which connects the
# user_registered signal sent by the django-registration app. Also, to
# avoid cyclic imports, there is no better place than here.
