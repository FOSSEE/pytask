Hi {{ name }},
   We are pleased to inform you that we are opening task claims from
today. This means that you can start working on your textbooks from
today. Along with this, we are excited to announce the first round
of Sprints!

Date: Wednesday 9th February, 2011
Time: 19:00 HRS to 23:59 HRS (Pizzas and Donuts will be served during
sprints. If you think this slot is too long, you may choose to leave
after you have got some work done.)
Venue: Classrooms, Aero Annex, Ground floor HSS Building (ALH and ACR)


We would like all of you to have claimed the tasks and ensured that you
have some tasks to work on before you come for the Sprints. The steps
to follow to claim the task are:

1. Log in to the website with your username and password.
2. Navigate to page that lists all the textbooks, by clicking on
   Textbooks link on the left sidebar.
3. Click on the Textbook title you would like to work on.
4. You must be able to see the list of tasks for that textbook. If
   you don't find a task for a particular textbook you are interested
   in, please don't claim the entire textbook. Raise this during the
   Sprint and we will fix it for you. Nevertheless, you are free to
   claim tasks from any other textbook you are interested in.
5. Click on the task listed on the page corresponding to the Textbook
   as show in the figure http://i.min.us/iefM1W.png
6. Once you enter the task page, click on the "View claims" link as
   shown in the figure http://i.min.us/iefDV2.png
7. Once you navigate to this page, you will see a textbox where you have
   to write a proposal as to why you would want to work on this task
   and hit Request claim button as shown in the figure
   http://i.min.us/iefKtQ.png
   NOTE: Each Task is designed for one person. So if multiple students
   claim the same task, the requests are approved based on the best
   proposal submitted.
8. This completes the task claim procedure. Once the coordinators/TAs
   approve your claim, you can start working on your task.


We are trying to have all the coordinators present during the Sprints,
so you can directly communicate with them if they have some issues.

If you face difficulties with task claims on the website, either
feel free to email me or you will be assisted with the same during
the sprints.


More Pizzas and Donuts!
